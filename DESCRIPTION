Description: Changepoint detection algorithms for R are widespread but have
    different interfaces and reporting conventions. 
    This makes the comparative analysis of results difficult. 
    We solve this problem by providing a tidy, unified interface for several 
    different changepoint detection algorithms. 
    We also provide consistent numerical and graphical reporting leveraging 
    the 'broom' and 'ggplot2' packages.
