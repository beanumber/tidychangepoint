Description: Changepoint detection algorithms for R are widespread but have
    different interfaces and reporting conventions. This makes the comparative
    analysis of results difficult. Tidychangepoint solves this problem by 
    providing a unified interface for several different changepoint detection 
    algorithms. It also provides consistent numerical and graphical reporting 
    using the broom and ggplot2 packages.
