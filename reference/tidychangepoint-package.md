# tidychangepoint: A Tidy Framework for Changepoint Detection Analysis

Changepoint detection algorithms for R are widespread but have different
interfaces and reporting conventions. This makes the comparative
analysis of results difficult. We solve this problem by providing a
tidy, unified interface for several different changepoint detection
algorithms. We also provide consistent numerical and graphical reporting
leveraging the 'broom' and 'ggplot2' packages.
