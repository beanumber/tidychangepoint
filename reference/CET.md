## Details

The CET time series is perhaps the longest instrumental record of
surface temperatures in the world, commencing in 1659 and spanning 362
years through 2020. The CET series is a benchmark for European climate
studies, as it is sensitive to atmospheric variability in the North
Atlantic (Parker et al. 1992). This record has been previously analyzed
for long-term changes (Plaut et al. 1995; Harvey and Mills 2003;
Hillebrand and Proietti 2017); however, to our knowledge, no detailed
changepoint analysis of it has been previously conducted. The length of
the CET record affords us the opportunity to explore a variety of
temperature features.
